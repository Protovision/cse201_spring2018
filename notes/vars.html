			<h1>Variables, Types, and Values</h1>

			<p>Variables are named regions of storage within a C++ program. They are places where data can be stored and retrieved. A variable is introduced into a C++ program through a declaration that specifies at least 2 things: the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type"><i>type</i></a> of the variable and the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/identifiers#Names"><i>name</i></a> of the variable.</p>

			<p>The type of a variable provides the way to interpret the data that is to be stored in that variable. The name of a variable provides a way for one to identify that variable in later parts of the C++ program.</p>
			
			<p>Here are the types that one should know for now:</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><tt>bool</tt></td>
					<td>Boolean, for storing the value <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><tt>char</tt></td>
					<td>Character, for storing a value such as: <tt>'A'</tt>, <tt>'1'</tt>, <tt>'?'</tt>, or <tt>' '</tt></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><tt>int</tt></td>
					<td>Integer, for storing a value such as: <tt>42</tt>, <tt>-7</tt>, or <tt>0</tt></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><tt>double</tt></td>
					<td>"Double precision floating point", for storing a value such as: <tt>3.4</tt>, <tt>-9.81</tt>, or <tt>0.0</tt></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><tt>string</tt></td>
					<td>For storing a sequence of characters such as the value <tt>"Hello world"</tt></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>A value expressed directly (such as: <tt>true</tt>, <tt>'A'</tt>, or <tt>42</tt>) is known as a <i>literal</i>. There are <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bool_literal"><i>boolean literals</i></a>, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/character_literal"><i>character literals</i></a>, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal"><i>integer literals</i></a>, <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/floating_literal"><i>floating-point literals</i></a>, and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/string_literal"><i>string literals</i></a>.</p>

			<p>Boolean literals are of type <tt>bool</tt>. The other 4 kinds of literals can have their type modified through prefixes or suffixes, but their default types are: <tt>char</tt> for character literals, <tt>int</tt> for integer literals, <tt>double</tt> for floating-point literals, and a type that is compatible with <tt>string</tt> for string literals.</p>

			<p>A variable stores a value and a value can be expressed as a literal. Whenever one attempts to store a value into a variable, one must make sure that the type of the value and the type of the variable are compatible.</p>

			<p>The following is a <i>simple declaration</i> for a variable:</p>

			<code>
int x;
			</code>

			<p>This declaration allocates a region of storage that is large enough to store any value of type <tt>int</tt>, the identifier <tt>x</tt> is then introduced as the name of this storage. The value of this variable depends on the context of where it was declared; for now, one should assume that a variable has an <i>indeterminate value</i> unless one explicitly <i>assigns</i> a value to it first.</p>

			<p>A variable can be assigned a value using an assignment operator. This can be performed within a simple declaration:</p>

			<code>
int x = 0;
			</code>

			<p>Now <tt>x</tt> is guaranteed to have the value 0. <i>Simple assignment</i> can also be performed after the variable has been declared and the operand that can be used for assigning can include: a literal, a variable, or an expression.</p>

			<code>
int a = 0;
int b = 4;
int c = a;
a = b;
b = 7;
			</code>

			<p>When the source code above executes, the values of the variables will be: 4 for <tt>a</tt>, 7 for <tt>b</tt>, and 0 for <tt>c</tt>.</p>

			<h1>Scope</h1>

			<p>All variables and other named entities have a <i>scope</i>, which determines the portion of source code in which that name is valid.</p>

			<p>Study the following source code and the comments included with it.</p>

			<p>The insertion of <tt>endl</tt> into <tt>cout</tt> has the same effect as inserting a new line character into <tt>cout</tt>.</p>

			<p>Variable <tt>a</tt> is said to be in <i>global scope</i>, which means it's <i>potential scope</i> begins at the <i>point of declaration</i> and ends at the end of the source file.</p>

			<p>The other variables all have <i>block scope</i> because they are all declared inside some <i>block</i>, which is a brace-enclosed sequence of statements.</p>

			<p>Variable <tt>b</tt> was declared in the block that is also the function body of <tt>main</tt>; <tt>b</tt>'s potential scope ends at the end of the <tt>main</tt> function. However, there is a nested block inside <tt>main</tt>'s function body; the declaration of another variable named <tt>b</tt> interrupts the scope of the previously declared <tt>b</tt>. Within this nested block scope, any appearance of <tt>b</tt> refers to the second <tt>b</tt> variable. After the nested scope ends, the scope of the first <tt>b</tt> resumes.</p>

			<p>The second <tt>c</tt> variable is an entirely different variable from the first <tt>c</tt> because the first <tt>c</tt> already expired at the end of the nested block. Since the second <tt>b</tt> is also out of scope, the second <tt>int c = b;</tt> declaration assigns the value of the first <tt>b</tt>.</p>

			<p>The <i>actual scope</i> of a variable is the same as it's potential scope unless that variable's scope becomes interrupted by another entity with the same name within a nested scope.</p>
