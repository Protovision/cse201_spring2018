			<h3>Computer science</h3>

			<p>The name "computer science" is an accurate name in the sense that computers are heavily used in this science which is a science insofar as knowledge is being inquired into.</p>

			<p>However, "computer science" should not be taken to mean "the study of computers" or even "the science of computers" because the computer, as it exists today, is a product of our creation. The computer is already built and thus there is no need to study it except to improve it.</p>

			<p>There are generally 2 things that are being studied in computer science: computation and information. The fruits of this study can be demonstrated and applied by programming a computer, a robot, a car, or anything else that can perform a task based on a specific set of instructions.</p>

			<p>One could say that computation and information are also being studied in mathematics and logic; there is also a lot of overlap between the knowledge that lies within these 3 domains. What makes computer science stand apart from mathematics and logic is an emphasis on time and space which constrains what can be computed and represented within a computer.</p>

			<h3>Computers and operating systems</h3>

			<p>Computers rely on programs to operate. A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute. The most important program that all computers have is an operating system. The operating system is a program (or set of programs) that directly controls the computer, this includes control of: the mouse, the keyboard, the monitor, the fan, the networking interface, and the file storage devices. The operating system controls every physical component that makes up the computer.</p>

			<p>There are many brands of operating systems today, but the 3 most popular desktop operating systems are: Windows, macOS, and Linux. The 2 most popular mobile operating systems are: Android and iOS.</p>

			<p>Operating systems directly control the computer on behalf of other programs known as applications (now today known as "apps"). Users (the ones between the keyboard and chair) use applications to: browse the web, play music, edit documents, collect and edit pictures, and play games among many other things applications can provide.</p>

			<p>Most operating systems have built-in interactive functionality for file management and application management that the user can access through buttons, menus, and windows. This type of interaction is possible when the program provides a "Graphical User Interface" (GUI) to the user.</p>

			<h3>The command-line interface</h3>
	
			<p>Many graphical operating systems provide a program known as a command shell. The command shell is a program that allows the user to access various operating system services through an interface known as a command-line interface (CLI). A CLI is an interface with a text-only display and a keyboard-only input where the input takes the form of commands entered line-by-line.</p>

			<p>The most popular brand of command shell for macOS and Linux is known as bash and it can be accessed through a program called the terminal. The command shell for Windows is known as the command prompt.</p>

			<p>The command shell is an important program used by computer scientists and other advanced computer users for detailed and automated control of a computer.</p>

			<h3>The file system</h3>

			<p>Before using a command shell, it is essential to have knowledge of the computer's file system.</p>

			<p>Despite a lack of standardization for file system concepts, there is a common understanding of file systems and the following definitions will apply for this course:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A file is a an object in the file system that holds data.</li>
				<li>A directory is a file that acts like a container or location for other files, a directory is also known as a folder.</li>
				<li>A file name is sequence of characters that names a file.</li>
				<li>A path is a sequence of elements that identifies a file. There are 2 types of paths:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>An absolute path unambiguously identifies the location of a file on the file system.</li>
						<li>A relative path identifies the location of a file relative to some directory on the file system.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
