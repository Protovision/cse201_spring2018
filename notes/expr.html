			<p>In C++, computation is expressed in an <i>expression</i> which is composed of <i>operators</i> and <i>operands</i>.</p>

			<p>The first expression that was shown so far was a <i>stream insertion</i> expression:</p>

			<code>
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!\n";
			</code>

			<p>Here, it's not apparent that computation is taking place; in fact, computation need not take place in an expression. What matters is that an operator is being used, this one being the <i>stream insertion operator</i> as denoted by <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>.</p>

			<p>Most expressions produce a result which is a value that can further be used by another operand within the same expression statement. The insertion operator returns it's left operand, thus one can "chain" additional insertion operations to the same object. The above statement could have been rewritten as:</p>

			<code>
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; "world!" &lt;&lt; "\n";
			</code>

			<h1>Input/Output</h1>
			
			<p>An expression that uses the stream insertion operator does not "produce a result" in the sense of creating a new value, it returns the same value that was used for it's left operand whose type must be <tt>ostream</tt> to begin with.</p>

			<p>The type of <tt>cout</tt> is <tt>ostream</tt>, it represents an <i>output stream</i>. A <i>stream</i> is an interface for transmitting data in an ordered sequence. An output stream only allows one to send data while an input stream only allows one to receive data. An Input/Output stream allows both. As you already know the stream insertion operator is used for sending data to an output stream.</p>

			<p><tt>cout</tt>, which stands for "character output", is associated with the program's <i>standard output stream</i>; it is one of the 3 <i>standard streams</i> that every program has as it's own.</p>

			<p>For console applications it is usually the case that: the <i>standard output stream</i> (<tt>cout</tt>) is associated with the terminal window, the <i>standard input stream</i> (<tt>cin</tt>) is associated with the keyboard, and the <i>standard error stream</i> (<tt>cerr</tt>) is also associated with the terminal window.</p>

			<p><tt>cout</tt> and <tt>cerr</tt> are used the same way for different purposes, <tt>cout</tt> is for sending normal messages and <tt>cerr</tt> is for sending error messages. <tt>cin</tt> is for receiving data, usually from the user and the operator used for receiving data from an input stream is the <i>stream extraction operator</i>, symbolized by <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>.</p>
		
			<p>The following terms are roughly synonomous with "input": read, receive, extract, scan, get</p>

			<p>The following terms are roughly synonomous with "output": write, send, insert, print, put</p>

			<p>The following program scans 2 numbers and prints the sum of those numbers.</p>

			<p>Line 5 demonstrates the declaration of multiple variables of the same type in one statement.</p>

			<p>Line 7 demonstrates the extraction of 2 values from <tt>cin</tt> into the variables <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.</p>

			<p>Line 8 demonstrates assignment to <tt>c</tt> from the value of the addition expression where the values of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are added. The result of such an addition expression is a temporary <tt>double</tt> value; the values of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> remain unmodified.</p>

			<h1>Computation</h1>

			<p>These are some of the <i>arithmetic operators</i> provided by C++, the column labeled "Syntax" shows how they can be used in an expression where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> can be any <i>subexpression</i> of appropriate types.</p>

			<p>The arithmetic operators are usable on all arithmetic types which include <tt>int</tt> and <tt>double</tt>. Other types may support the use of certain arithmetic operators but the semantics of their use may entirely be different.</p>

			<p>The unary plus and unary minus operators are known as <i>unary operators</i> because they each only require 1 operand. The other operators shown above are <i>binary operators</i> since they each require 2 operands.</p>

			<p>The following unary operators are used for incrementing/decrementing the value of a variable; unlike the above operators, these operators modify the variable for which they are used on.</p>

			<h1>Operator precedence</h1>

			<p>The rules of <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence"><i>operator precedence</i></a> in C++ determine the order of the evaluation of subexpressions within an expression.</p>

			<p>Generally: increment/decrement expressions are evaluated first, multiplication/division/modulo expressions are evaluated second, addition/subtraction expressions are evaluated third, and assignment is evaluated last.</p>

			<p>The <i>associativity</i> of an operator determines the order of the evaluation of an operator's operands. The associativity of an operator is either <i>Left-to-right</i> or <i>Right-to-left</i>. For example, the expression <tt>a + b</tt> has Left-to-right associativity since <tt>a</tt> is evaluated first and then <tt>b</tt>. The associativity of <tt>a = b</tt> is Right-to-left since <tt>b</tt> is evaluated first and then <tt>a</tt>.</p>
